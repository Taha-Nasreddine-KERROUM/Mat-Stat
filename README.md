# Mat-Stat
C functions to manipulate matrices:

• Function readMatrix() to allocate memory for a matrix of size NxM of real numbers (N and M 

given as parameters) and read the elements of the matrix. 

• Function printMatrix() to display (in matrix format) a matrix of reals given as a parameter. 

• Function statistics() that calculates and returns the maximum, minimum, and mean of the 

elements of the matrix received as a parameter. 

Example of output Please enter the number of rows of the matrix : 2

Please enter the number of columns of the matrix: 3

Please enter the elements of the matrix :

M(0,0) = 5 

M(0,1) = 10

M(0,2) = 15

M(1,0) = 10

M(1,1) = 20

M(1,2) = 8

The entered matrix is :

 5.00 10.00 15.00

10.00 20.00 8.00

The maximum element is 20.00, the minimum is 5.00, and the mean is 11.33
